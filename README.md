Risk is defined in financial terms as the chance that an outcome or investment's actual gains will differ from an expected outcome or return. 
Risk includes the possibility of losing some or all of the original investment.
Quantifiably, the risk is usually assessed by considering historical behaviors and outcomes. In finance, the standard deviation is a common metric associated with risk. Standard deviation provides a measure of the volatility of a value in comparison to its historical average
Credit analysis evaluates the riskiness of debt instruments issued by companies or entities to measure the entity's ability to meet its obligations. 
It also seeks to identify the appropriate level of default risk associated with investing in that particular entity. 
The outcome of the credit analysis will determine what risk rating to assign the debt issuer or borrower.
It is a rigorous evaluation and inspection of the borrower's financial past, ways of income, and ability to repay the borrowed credit by the lending institution. This provides lending companies with a good sense of the borrower's credit-paying capability.

To know more about risk analytics in financial services we have imported the data from Kaggle which aims to determine the loan analysis for banking or financial institutions. We have also developed a basic understanding of risk analytics in financial services and how data is used to reduce the risk of losing money when lending to customers by considering the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms. Also, we have performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the basis of various attributes like gender, loan status, family member count, education type, etc which gives the background of the customer for financial institutions while lending money. We are trying to develop a predictive classifier model and calculate their respective Confusion matrix, Area Under Curve, and ROC to select the best model for our problem.
