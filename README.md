<h1>RISK ANALYTICS IN FINANCIAL SERVICES</h1>

To know more about risk analytics in financial services we have imported the data from Kaggle which aims to determine the loan analysis for banking or financial institutions. We have also developed a basic understanding of risk analytics in financial services and how data is used to reduce the risk of losing money when lending to customers by considering the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms. Also, we have performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the basis of various attributes like gender, loan status, family member count, education type, etc which gives the background of the customer for financial institutions while lending money. We are trying to develop a predictive classifier model and calculate their respective Confusion matrix, Area Under Curve, and ROC to select the best model for our problem.
 Steps Involved :
 
 1) Data Extraction
 2) Data Manipulation
 3) Exploratory Data Analysis
 4) Model building
 
 Evaluation Metrics :
1) Confusion matrix
2) Area Under Curve, and ROC
